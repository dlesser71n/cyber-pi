## Sales Positioning Strategies

### Against Recorded Future

**Core Message:**  
*"Recorded Future provides data. We provide decisions. Get 80% of the value at 15% of the cost, plus strategic guidance they don't offer."*

**Proof Points:**
- Show cost comparison: $80K/year → $15K/year = $325K saved over 5 years
- Demonstrate industry customization: Aviation-specific vs generic
- Highlight strategic features: Gartner mapping, budget roadmaps, quick wins

**Sales Tools Needed:**
1. Side-by-side comparison sheet
2. ROI calculator (5-year savings)
3. Sample industry-specific report vs Recorded Future generic
4. Customer testimonial: "Why we switched from Recorded Future"

**Objection Handling:**

*"Recorded Future has 1,000+ sources vs your 80"*  
→ "Quality over quantity. We curate 80 high-signal sources vs 1,000 noisy feeds. Our clients spend 30 minutes reading actionable intelligence, not 8 hours filtering noise."

*"They're the market leader"*  
→ "They're the expensive leader. We're the value leader. Same destination, better ROI. Would you rather drive a $150K car or a $25K car that gets you there faster?"

*"We need brand recognition for the board"*  
→ "Your board will recognize $65K annual savings. Plus our reports are actually board-ready - strategic roadmaps, not data dumps."

---

### Against ThreatConnect

**Core Message:**  
*"ThreatConnect is a platform for large SOC teams. We're strategic intelligence for lean teams that need to know what to do, not build playbooks."*

**Differentiation:**
- Simplicity: Reports vs complex platform
- Strategic: Gartner mapping + budget roadmaps (they don't have)
- Industry depth: 18 verticals vs surface packages
- Cost: 60% savings ($15K vs $40K+)

**Sales Tools Needed:**
1. "ThreatConnect Migration Guide"
2. Complexity comparison (5-min setup vs 3-month deployment)
3. Strategic value demonstration
4. "Platform fatigue" messaging

**Objection Handling:**

*"ThreatConnect has SOAR automation"*  
→ "True. Do you have a 20-person SOC team building playbooks? If not, you're paying for unused features. We focus on what lean teams actually need: strategic intelligence."

*"We need a platform, not reports"*  
→ "Fair point. ThreatConnect is the right choice for platform needs. We're the right choice for strategic decision-making. What's your primary goal?"

*"They have community threat sharing"*  
→ "Yes, valuable for large teams. We provide curated intelligence so you don't have to filter community noise. Different approaches for different needs."

### Against Mandiant

**Core Message:**  
*"Mandiant is the Porsche - elite and expensive. We're the Tesla - advanced technology at accessible pricing. Both get you there; one is 20x cheaper."*

**Positioning:**
- Don't compete directly (different leagues)
- Complement: "Use Mandiant for elite IR, use us for daily intel + strategy"
- Different buyer: Fortune 100 vs Fortune 500-1000

**Partnership Opportunity:**
- Refer to Mandiant for elite IR needs
- Mandiant refers mid-market to us
- Win-win collaboration

**Sales Tools:**
- "When to use Mandiant vs cyber-pi" guide
- Complementary positioning materials
- Partnership proposal for Mandiant

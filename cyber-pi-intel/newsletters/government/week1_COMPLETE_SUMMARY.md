- Supply chain compromise
- 18,000 customers affected (9 federal agencies confirmed)
- Dwell time: 9+ months
- Cost: Billions (response + rebuild)
- Lesson: Supply chain security, zero trust, assume breach

**Case Study 2: Colonial Pipeline (2021, still lessons)**
- Ransomware impact on critical infrastructure
- Not government but government response
- DarkSide ransomware, $4.4M paid
- Fuel shortages, state of emergency
- Lesson: OT security, backup procedures, public-private coordination

**Case Study 3: City of Atlanta (2018, recurring pattern)**
- SamSam ransomware, city services down
- Cost: $17M (recovery, no ransom paid)
- Recovery: Months
- Lesson: State/local cybersecurity funding critical

**Top 10 Government Lessons:**
1. Nation-states = primary threat (not criminals)
2. Supply chain is attack vector (SolarWinds playbook)
3. Zero trust mandatory (EO 14028 compliance)
4. Election security = national security
5. State/local underfunded (< 3% IT budget for security)
6. Insider threats significant (classified access = risk)
7. Critical infrastructure pre-positioning (Chinese ticking time bombs)
8. Ransomware payment rate low (23% vs 58% private sector)
9. Federal-state-local coordination essential (CISA, FBI, MS-ISAC)
10. Public transparency matters (election security confidence)
